# Simon - The Memory Game

I've created this game based on on a YouTube tutorial from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_ec3eowFLQ), which also includes a [link for the full code on gitHub](https://github.com/beaucarnes/simon-game).

Although based on previous code, it has some variations.
